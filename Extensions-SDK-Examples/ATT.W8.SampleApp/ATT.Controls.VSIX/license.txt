(b)	AT&T may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the Service Materials at any time without notice. AT&T is not obligated to provide You with any updates to the Service Materials. If AT&T makes updates to the Service Materials, the terms of this Agreement will govern them, unless the update is accompanied by a separate license. AT&T has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any updates to the Service Materials to anyone in the future. Should an update be made available, it may have features, services or functionality that are different from those offered under this Agreement and may be incompatible with Applications developed on previous versions of the Service Materials.

(c)	You may not (1) modify, adapt or translate any of the Components, (2) reverse engineer, reverse compile or disassemble any of the Components, (3) use the Components in any way that will (or will attempt to) (i) intentionally or willfully infringe on any AT&T or third party Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) interfere with the use of AT&T's network or systems, or the network of any other provider, (iii) interfere with the use or enjoyment of services received by others, (iv) result in the publication of threatening or Unsuitable Content, or constitute spam, or (v) violate an Application user's privacy, the security of AT&T's (or another party's) servers, network, network access, personal computer or control devices, software or data, or other system , (4) rent, lease, redistribute, resell or display any of the Components, (5) circumvent, disable or tamper with any security-related components or other protective measures applicable to the Components or (6) reproduce, archive, retransmit, distribute, disseminate, sell, lease, rent, exchange, modify, broadcast, synchronize, publicly perform, publish, publicly display, make available to third parties, transfer or circulate the Components except as otherwise allowed under Section 3.

(e)	You may only access the Components through the token key issued to You. You may not provide your token key to any other person or party without AT&T's written permission. AT&T reserves the right to revoke Your token key at any time, validate Your IP and/or domain address, and to block requests that AT&T deems in Your sole discretion to be malicious or abusive.

(f) You shall not use any API with any Application to operate dangerous facilities, life support, or other mission critical applications where human life or property may be at stake. You understand that the API's are not designed for such purposes and that Your failure in such cases could lead to death, personal injury, or severe property or environmental damage for which AT&T is not responsible.

(g)	 The number of calls you will be permitted to make during any given period through an API ("Calls") may be limited. AT&T will determine on various factors, including the ways Your Application may be used or the anticipated volume of use associated with Your Application. The amount of the rate limit may change from time to time in AT&T's sole discretion. You understand and agree that programmatic methods intended to subvert rate limiting are considered violations of these terms. Calls may be subject to AT&T's controls concerning the maximum number of Calls that You can send during a period of time ("Throughput"). Throughput is measured in Transactions per Second (TPS) such that each Call typically constitutes a transaction and AT&T reserves the right to limit TPS. You must comply with the API's in handling temporary or permanent errors in connection with flow-control and message re-tries.

AT&T may use technical measures to prevent over usage and/or stop usage after any usage limitations are exceeded.

(h)	 You will report to AT&T within 24 hours any security deficiencies in or intrusions to Your systems that You discover where the API or End User data ("Security Information") have been acquired by an unauthorized person ("Security Breach"). Such reports must be delivered to developer.program@att.com. You will work with AT&T to correct any Security Breach immediately, and will disconnect immediately any intrusions or intruder. In the event of such a Security Breach (or where AT&T reasonably believes that the API's or the Security Information has been compromised), AT&T may suspend or terminate Your access to the API. You agree to adhere at all time to best security practices within the industry. Upon good cause, AT&T will have the right, at Your own expense, to review, or to have an independent third party that is not Your competitor, inspect and review Your security procedures. You will (at Your own expense) correct any security flaws detected by such a review as soon as possible. You will then promptly certify to AT&T in writing that the security flaw has been corrected, along with a description of the corrective action(s) taken. AT&T will give You 72 hours notice before conducting such a review, and may conduct no more than four reviews annually. Any such review will be conducted during regular business hours in such a manner as not to interfere with normal business activities. If a review reveals a material breach of security provisions, You will reimburse AT&T for the reasonable costs of the review.

(i) You may use AT&T User Data only to perform your obligations under this Agreement. You will not use any AT&T User Data for direct marketing or promotions to AT&T customers. You will not distribute AT&T User Data to any third party without the prior written approval of AT&T.

3.3.5	No Cramming and Clear and Conspicuous Disclosure
This Agreement permits You to originate charges billed to End Users.


3.3.5.1	NO CRAMMING
A.	CPUC Decision. The Public Utilities Commission of the State of California published Decision 10-10-034, which revised rules governing third party billing for purposes of combating "cramming" events ("CPUC Decision"). In connection with the CPUC Decision, AT&T is required to make reasonable inquiry of Your company's history of violations of state or federal laws and rules relating to consumer protection ("Rules") and concerning Your company's current ability to operate lawfully ("Reasonable Inquiry"). In furtherance of the foregoing:

(a)	You acknowledge and agree that all charges added by or on behalf of You to AT&T bills will be in compliance with the CPUC Decision.

(b)	You warrant that You are currently able to operate lawfully and that, except as provided in the space below, You do not have a history of violations of the Rules. 
You warrant that You will provide to AT&T under separate cover a complete list of all complaints, including complaints lodged by state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, or the Federal Trade Commission, and all lawsuits related to consumer protection issues, including but not limited to, unfair or deceptive business practices and improper billing that, in each case, resulted in a finding of a violation of the Rules. You agree to notify AT&T in writing promptly, prior to submitting charges on AT&T bills, if additional items should be added to any disclosure previously made by You to AT&T under this Section.

(c)	You agree to make Reasonable Inquiry of Your third-party content providers ("Content Suppliers") prior to commencing billing services for any such Content Suppliers, and on an ongoing basis, that, at a minimum, includes the following questions:

1) whether or not the Content Supplier is currently able to operate lawfully, and
2) whether or not the Content Supplier has a history of violations of the Rules.
Without limiting the generality of this inquiry, You must ask whether, in the last five years, the Content Supplier has been the subject of any complaints, including complaints lodged by state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, or the Federal Trade Commission, or any lawsuits related to consumer protection issues, including but not limited to, unfair or deceptive business practices and improper billing that, in each case, resulted in a finding of a violation of the Rules.
If You determine that a Content Supplier has a history of violating the Rules or is not currently able to operate lawfully, You agree (i) to notify AT&T in writing promptly, and (ii) not to include charges for that You on AT&T bills.

B.	Truth in Billing. You agree that You will submit to AT&T for billing and collection only true and correct charges properly authorized by End Users. In that regard, You warrant and represent that. prior to submitting any charge to AT&T and prior to obtaining the End User's consent to include a charge on the End User's bill, You or Content Supplier will thoroughly inform the End User of the product or service being offered, including all associated charges such as any term commitments or termination charges, and will explicitly inform the End User that the associated charges for the product or service will be rendered in the AT&T End User's bill. AT&T reserves the right to require You to send a written confirmation (via mail or email) to End Users notifying them of the product or service subscription or purchase, the date charges will begin to appear on the End User's bill, the amounts of all charges to be billed, and the process the End User should follow to cancel the subscription or otherwise return or terminate the product or service.

C. Certain Remedies. In addition to AT&T's other remedies, if You submit any items for billing on AT&T bills that do not comply with the requirements of this Appendix A-1, AT&T may, at its sole discretion: (a) decline to process any such further transactions on behalf of You until You establish methods, procedures, programming or other measures deemed necessary by AT&T to ensure that You comply with such requirements; and/or (b) withhold payment of any amounts due to You up to the greater of (i) the amount AT&T reasonably believes may be affected by Your breach, or (ii) the amount AT&T reasonably believes to represent the maximum potential liability of AT&T as a result of any lawsuits, enforcement actions, or other disputes or claims of any kind resulting from such breach. In the event AT&T elects to withhold payment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section C, AT&T will provide written notice to You no less than ten (10) calendar days prior to beginning to withhold payment. During those ten (10) calendar days, the parties will meet to discuss the issue.

3.3.5.2.	CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS DISCLOSURES.

3.3.5.2.1	Definitions. 
As used in this sub-section 3.3.5.2, the following definitions shall apply:
"Clear and Conspicuous" means that a statement is made in a manner readily noticeable and understandable to the persons to whom it is directed. To determine whether a statement is clear and conspicuous, factors to consider include:

i) whether it is located sufficiently near any other statement that clarifies, modifies, or explains it;
ii) whether it contradicts, or renders confusing or ambiguous, any other statement; and
iii) whether it is or appears to be inconsistent with any other statement.
"Mobile Content" refers to content, applications, and goods and services sold by You under this Attachment A-1.

"Initial Representation" means all sponsored links, banner ads, pop-ups, e-mail subject lines, and any and all other primary impressions created or presented by You relating to Your advertisement of Mobile Content.

3.3.5.2.2	Prohibited Use. In connection with any Internet-based purchase of Mobile Content subscriptions by an End User, the following is prohibited:

A.	the use of the terms "free," "complimentary," "no charge," "without charge," or any other term that reasonably leads a customer to believe that he or she may receive something of value, entirely or in part without a requirement of compensation in any form, or that tends to convey the impression to the consuming public that an article of merchandise or service is "free," unless the Initial Representation to the customer clearly and conspicuously states that the free item may be received by a customer pursuant to his or her authorization of billing for a paid subscription plan, the price of the plan, and its term. For example, a free ringtone offer requiring a customer to subscribe to a monthly subscription plan at a cost of $9.99 per month shall say, "Free ringtone with paid monthly subscription of $9.99/month."

B.	the advertisement or promotion of any Mobile Content that is available only through certain wireless carriers, unless the advertisement clearly and conspicuously discloses that the Mobile Content is not available through all carriers.

C.	the advertisement or promotion of Mobile Content that is available only on certain makes or models of mobile devices unless the advertisement clearly and conspicuously discloses that the Mobile Content is not available on all mobile devices.

D.	the inclusion in any offer of a term or condition necessary to its acceptance whereby the customer agrees to accept advertising or promotional Messages delivered electronically to cell phones via text messaging, email or otherwise, that are unrelated to the current offer, unless consented to by the customer.

E.	the placement of pre-checked boxes in an offer intended to be used for acceptance of a term(s) or condition(s) of the offer.

3.3.5.2.3	You must. In connection with any Internet-based purchase of Mobile Content subscriptions by an End User, You must:

A.	clearly and conspicuously disclose the price and billing period of the recurring charge of the Mobile Content immediately adjacent to any cell-phone-number-submit field and any PIN-code-submit field, e.g., "$9.99 per month."

B.	clearly and conspicuously disclose on any cell-phone-number-submit web page and any PIN-code-submit web page the following material terms and conditions:

1.	the initial and recurring charge for the Mobile Content,
2.	whether other charges may apply,
3.	that the customer's account will be charged automatically with no further action on the part of the customer; the frequency with which the charge will automatically be made to the account in the absence of cancellation of the plan; and that the customer will continue to receive the charges until the customer cancels the plan,
4.	how to cancel the plan,
5.	the mechanism for charging the customer, e.g., "on your cell phone bill or deducted from your prepaid balance on your cell phone account," and
6.	that the purchase must be authorized by the User.
C.	provide an Internet hyperlink to the terms and conditions of the offer on every cell-phone-number-submit page and PIN-code-submit page in the Internet order path.


3.3.6	International Developers. If You operate outside of the United States (50 states and associated territorial waters) and payment will be made to You outside of the United States ("International Developer"), You must maintain an End User License Agreement ("EULA") which, at a minimum, (a) may not have a defined term, (b) is not terminable by You for Your convenience (i.e., is terminable only for legitimate commercial reasons, such as breach of the EULA by the customer), and (c) must provide that Your Application is made available "As Is."

3.4	Certain Rights. Subject to Your compliance with the terms hereof, AT&T hereby grants to You a non exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right and license (a) to use the Application Billing Components in accordance with this Application Billing Attachment, and (b) to make available Application Billing to Your Applications. 

4.	Transactions and Revenue Share. 
4.1	Appointment. You hereby authorize and instruct AT&T to issue invoices for the purchase price payable by End Users for transactions through Application Billing (collectively, "Transactions").

4.2	Revenue Share. In consideration of the billing-on-behalf-of (BOBO) service provided by AT&T, AT&T will retain thirty percent (30%) of the "Net Revenue" generated by Transactions (including any sales of content, programs and/or Applications through the Transactions) under this Agreement ("Revenue Share"). AT&T will remit the remaining portion of the Net Revenue as provided below. For these purposes, "Net Revenue" means the gross price collected from End Users for the Transactions (excluding any transport, telecommunications or similar charges or any sales, use or other taxes or governmental charges) minus any credits issued by AT&T. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum Revenue Share with respect to a Transaction is $.50 per item ("Minimum Revenue Share"). The Minimum Revenue Share may be adjusted by AT&T on reasonable written notice by AT&T. The foregoing Revenue Share will apply to any item placed by You on an End User's bill through the AT&T Billing System. AT&T reserves the right to change Revenue Share on sixty (60) days' notice to You. If You do not agree with such change, You may terminate this Agreement on written notice to AT&T, effective at the end of such sixty-day period. If You do not so notify AT&T, then such changed Revenue Share will be effective at the end of such period.

4.3	Remittance. AT&T will calculate the amount due to be remitted or paid to You (collectively "Remittance") at the end of every calendar month. You will integrate into the AT&T designated billing vendor ("Billing Vendor") in compliance with Billing Vendor requirements. Once integrated, You will have access to the vendor on-line reporting system. In addition, AT&T will provide a statement describing the Remittance due to You, and pay that Remittance to You in United States dollars, within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar month through its designated billing vendor. If the amount owed You for any month is less than $25.00, AT&T may not mail a statement or payment until the next regular accounting period at which time the amounts owed (including withheld amounts) exceed $25.00. AT&T agrees to maintain accurate books and records regarding the Remittance payable to You under this Agreement. Each statement will be deemed final and binding unless You provide notice of Your specific objections thereto to AT&T within one (1) year of the date on which such statement was issued.

4.4	No Music-Related Fees. You agree that the Revenue Share described above is inclusive of all amounts of any kind whatsoever due You or to any songwriters, publishers, featured or non-featured performers, producers, engineers, mixers, re-mixers and any other third parties who may be entitled to compensation as a result of AT&T's (or its Users') use of the Applications or any musical works embodied in the Applications (including any amounts that may be payable in connection with the public performance of any musical work embodied in any Application) under this Agreement.

4.5	Bad Debt. You recognize and agree that AT&T reserves the right to deduct from Remittances Your pro rata portion of bad debt for Transactions. For example, if an End User purchased an Application for $5 and the End User does not pay AT&T for the Transaction, AT&T would have the right to deduct $3.50 from Your Remittances with respect to that Transaction. To the extent that AT&T is unable to track bad debt to the line item or third-party provider, You agree that AT&T may apply its overall bad debt rate for purchases of digital content against Your pro rata share of Remittances.


4.6	Taxes. 
a.	In the event that any Transaction is subject to any sales, use or other similar tax, under applicable law, AT&T will collect and remit such tax on Your behalf in accordance with its standard operating procedures. AT&T will not collect and remit any tax imposed by any taxing jurisdiction outside the United States.

b.	You will indemnify and hold AT&T harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, except with respect to sales, use, or similar taxes collected by AT&T.

c.	You will provide reasonable cooperation to AT&T in the event that any taxing authority audits AT&T with respect to any taxes collected, withheld and/or remitted under this Section 4.6. In the event that any remittance made by AT&T to You is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the full amount of that withholding or similar tax will be solely for Your account, and will not reduce the revenue share to which AT&T is entitled on that transaction. You will provide reasonable cooperation to AT&T to enable AT&T to determine whether such tax is due, which shall include providing AT&T properly completed and executed United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Forms W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, W-8IMY, or W-9 (or any successor forms prescribed by the IRS), as applicable to You. If AT&T reasonably believes that such tax is due, AT&T will deduct the full amount of such withholding or similar tax from the gross amount of any remittance owed to You, and will pay the full amount withheld over to the competent tax authorities. AT&T will use commercially practical efforts to obtain, and to furnish to You, copies of official tax receipts or similar evidence of payment, confirming AT&T's payment of those withholding or similar taxes to the competent tax authorities. You will indemnify and hold AT&T harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority for any underpayment of any such withholding or similar taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by You as to Your entitlement to, or Your disqualification for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax.


4.7	Termination. This Appendix and all of AT&T's obligations hereunder will terminate upon the expiration or termination of the Master License Agreement. Notwithstanding any such termination, AT&T will be entitled to: (i) all Revenue Share payable with respect to Transactions occurring prior to the date of termination; and (ii) reimbursement from You of refunds or credits paid by AT&T to End Users, whether before or after the date of termination.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT TOOLS AGREEMENT

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU ("DEVELOPER") AND AT&T MOBILITY LLC, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY "AT&T").

THIS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT TOOLS AGREEMENT is entered into as of the date you click to Review and Acknowledge the terms hereof. 
The following terms and conditions shall govern Developer's borrowing and use of the AT&T Software Development Kit Tools (hereinafter "SDK Tools") and related documentation described in Attachment A:

1.	AT&T hereby loans to Developer, and Developer accepts, the AT&T SDK Tools for use by Developer during the term of this Agreement solely in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to this Agreement, AT&T hereby grants Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable revocable, royalty-free right and license, during the term of this Agreement, to use the AT&T SDK Tools internally within the Developer's company to test and evaluate the operation and performance of any of Developer's Application or mobile software. After the term of this Agreement, Developer, at its expense, shall promptly return the AT&T SDK Tools to AT&T or destroy them as requested by AT&T. As used in this Agreement, a Developer's Application shall mean software that runs on smartphones, mobile phones or mobile devices (including tablets). Mobile applications are designed to educate, entertain, or assist users in their daily lives. Software comprising a Developer's Application is contrasted with and shall not mean 'system software' and 'middleware,' which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities, while not directly applying in the performance of tasks that benefit the user. The 'system software' serves the Developer's Application, which in turn serves the user.

2.	Developer shall obtain permission from a mobile device user before evaluating any user data related to such user's use of Developer's Application or mobile software when such user data is obtained using any component of the AT&T SDK Tools installed on a mobile handset/device and connected or linked to a Developer or other server. Under no circumstances shall Developer obtain any mobile device user's personal identifiable information or location without first obtaining permission from such user. Any breach of this provision shall be considered a Material Breach and grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement including cessation of the use and return of all AT&T SDK Tools.

3.	AT&T shall retain all right, title and ownership interests to the AT&T SDK Tools (specifically excluding any Developer data and Developer's Application or mobile software) and no interest in the AT&T SDK Tools is transferred to Developer. Except as expressly authorized under this Agreement, Developer shall not use, copy, distribute, disassemble, modify, prepare derivative works based on, display, perform or transfer the AT&T SDK Tools or documentation provided therewith, and no licenses are granted or implied for such purposes.

4.	AT&T may at any time terminate this Agreement with Developer:

(a) Developer breaches any provision of this Agreement;
(b) AT&T is required to do so by law; or
(c) AT&T decides no longer to provide the SDK Tools available to Developer. If Developer wants to terminate this Agreement, it may do so by ceasing to use the SDK Tools or by giving written notice to AT&T. This Agreement, including all rights granted to Developer, shall terminate upon termination of this Agreement. Unless any written notice from AT&T shall provide otherwise, upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Developer shall return all items furnished by AT&T and, if AT&T requests, certify to AT&T the destruction of same. Developer's obligations under this Agreement, including its obligation under Sections 3, 5, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17 shall survive and continue after expiration or termination.
5.	AT&T and Developer shall each bear their respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor the furnishing of the SDK Tools hereunder shall constitute or imply any promise, commitment or intention to (in the case of Developer) make any present or future use of the AT&T SDK Tools by Developer to improve any of Developer's mobile software or for any other reason; or (in the case of AT&T) to offer the AT&T SDK Tools (or any commercial version of same) to Developer following the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

6.	Developer shall hold the AT&T SDK Tools, and any written information furnished by AT&T to Developer in furtherance of this Agreement (collectively, hereinafter, "AT&T Confidential Information"), in confidence for AT&T and shall only use the AT&T Confidential Information for the purpose permitted under this Agreement.

END OF GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

Attachment A

AT&T SDK Tools may include, but are not limited the following tools:

Whitepapers, technical articles, videos, podcasts, example applications, code snippets, webcasts, info-graphics, live application examples, libraries, IDE's, general tools(test harnesses, packaging tools, etc) all of which can be part of an SDK or downloaded separately.

In the cases AT&T distributes source code, such as with libraries, example apps, code snippets, AT&T allows the Developer to use this code and modify to work within their own application. AT&T Developer Program sees such code examples as a means to help improve Developer's Application quality and speed adoption on AT&T offered devices using AT&T APIs.

This list is an evergreen listing of tools available through the AT&T SDK Toolkit and will be modified from time to time to include new tools or delete existing tools. This agreement only applies to those tools you have downloaded.

Sencha Touch SDK: In order to speed your development with network APIs, AT&T has provided an SDK that exposes the network APIs in a library of simple user objects. The SDK extends the server-side libraries to WebKit browsers through elements of the Sencha Touch SDK. The Sencha Touch SDK has many UI elements that can complement your development and the visual appearance of your web pages, and speed development to multiple HTML5 devices.
